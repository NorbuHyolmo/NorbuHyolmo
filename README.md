I'm Norbu Lama. I just graduated with a bachelor's degree in information technology, and I'm enthusiastic about exploring the world of technology and software development. I really enjoy learning languages such as Html/CSS/Python and currently learning Django Web Framework. I also enjoy UI and designing in general and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies. I believe that the world of IT is a never-ending journey of discovery, and I'm excited to embark on this journey with a thirst for knowledge.

Skills: HTML/ CSS/ PYTHON / C#

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on myself. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Django and DSA.
